Ever been working in a dark area of your build that needs light, but you've got lighting already set up just how you want it?

Ever worked on a map with a lot of fog, but wanted to make sure your build looked good in it?

Development Lighting
-

***What is it?***
A quick method of jumping between a work-friendly and gameplay-intended lighting profile.

***How does it work?***
The plugin lets you move between two profiles in Lighting;
- **Game** -> The way that your game will look when people play it, your skybox, atmospheres, blurs, depth effects, anything and everything lighting based.
- **Development** -> A very basic lighting setup created specifically so that you can see your game, whether you're working in a dark environment, or a fog-heavy map.

When you toggle modes, all the Lighting properties are captured and stored as Attributes under the Game/Development Lighting profiles. 

The profiles are stored as objects; so you can save/publish/crash, and the setups will be the same when you come back.

***How do I edit a profile?***
Once you enter a mode, any changes you make to the lighting will be saved to that profile, adding skyboxes, changing the brightness - once you switch modes, that data is stored. This could prove useful if you're aiming to test different lighting setups.

***What happens if I accidentally save/publish without going into Game mode?***
- Entering Development mode saves your Game profile under Lighting
- When you re-open the place, the plugin will see this folder, and assume you're still in Development mode.
- Just toggle it again, your Game lighting profile is back.
